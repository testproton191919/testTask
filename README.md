Create a pull request here with the implementation of the following task: 

Create a java stand-alone project, that would be packed as a jar and would be have following public API:
```
public interface SummarizeNumbers {
    // returns result of the a + b , block with exceptions might be present or not by the choice of candidate.
    Integer sum(Integer a, Integer b) <throws Exceptions >;
}
```
Project should have a build script (gradle or maven). 
Recommended to write at least one test and some javadocs.
